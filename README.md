A lightweight TypeScript-based workflow engine for building and deploying custom automation pipelines to n8n.

The engine enables you to:

- Define workflows in code using reusable workflow nodes.
- Follow predeterimined workflow templates.
- Automate the generation of complex n8n workflows.
- Push workflows to your n8n instance using the API.

## Features

### Workflow Nodes

- **Schedule Trigger** â€” Schedule your workflows with custom Schedule Trigger Rules.

- **AI Agent** â€” Write a custom prompt and let AI do it's thing.

  > You can also add a fully custom node, extend nodes, and even create your own modular nodes.

### Workflows

- **Budget Report** â€” A workflow template for creating a scheduled budget report using [actual-mcp](https://github.com/adomas399/actual-mcp), that is then sent via email.

  > You can also use the base workflow template to add any desired nodes, for a fully custom workflow. Furthermore, you can create your own reusable workflow templates.

#### Workflow class methods

- **AddNode()** â€” Add any workflow node to the workflow
- **json()** â€” Get the workflow exported as json
- **push()** â€” Push the workflow to n8n via the API.
